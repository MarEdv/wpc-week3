# Weekly Programming Challenge #3

Jamis Buck publishes programming challenges on his blog at 
https://medium.com/@jamis/. This is my submission for week 3.

I did it in Haskell, which is a language I'm new to. My only experience
so far is from a course in functional programming I took at https://www.edx.org.
It took me some fighting to get the infrastructure up and running, which made
me late for the submission. I ended up using that Holy Project (https://github.com/yogsototh/holy-project) which is a project generator for Haskell using Cabal.

However, I completed the normal mode of the
maze solver, which included solving a perfect maze, i.e., a maze with no loops
and that always has one solution.

## Usage
Build: cabal build
Test: cabal test
Run: cabal run <filename>
